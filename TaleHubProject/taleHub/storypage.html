            It’s been a long day, and you’re just trying to get some sleep. But as you struggle to drift off, your mind wanders to the dark side. That’s when you know it’s time to get spooked!
            True crime podcasts, unsettling horror movies, creepypasta: getting your daily fix of the macabre is easier than ever and a welcome distraction from the daily grind. We’re not sure why people tend to feast on horror content just when they’re alone in a bedroom in the middle of the night, but we can totally relate. Nothing can tingle your nerves like reading a well-written horror story in the pitch dark of your room, especially when the plot focuses on realistic situations. Not ghosts, not zombies, not vampires: people can be even more terrifying.
            Heart racing like crazy, goosebumps, and the familiar pump of adrenaline — that’s the power of a scary story done right. And while we know the best way to enjoy the genre is through cinema and literature — and we encourage it! — there’s often just no time for any of that. That’s when short horror stories come in handy! Small pieces of dreadful entertainment ready to be devoured at a moment’s notice. So if you want to get your horror fix without having to sit through an entire film or read dozens of pages to get to the juicy part, then grab yourself a blanket, dim the lights, and settle in for some creepy stories.
            Bored Panda has combed the internet to find some of the best scary short stories. Some of these are two-sentence horror stories, perfect for getting horrified in a matter of seconds! You can read them in bed on your phone while your significant other sleeps soundly next to you, or alone with only a flicker of candlelight as a companion to your reading. Only one thing is sure: these spooky stories will have you clinging to your pillow for dear life tonight!

            We bought this run-down house, my boyfriend and I. While he started working on converting the kitchen into the main bedroom, I insisted on removing the old wallpaper. The previous owner papered every wall and ceiling in the house! It’s a lot of work to remove, but it feels so good to get rid of it. The best feeling is getting a long peel, like when your skin peels after a bad sunburn. I turned it into a game, on the hunt to rip the longest piece possible.
            I noticed there was a person’s name and date under a corner section of paper in every room. I couldn’t help but investigate and Googled those names. What I discovered left me speechless. The names all belonged to missing people, and the dates matched the day of their disappearance! We notified the police, who sent the crime scene team. I overheard one of them say, “Yeah, it’s human.” Wait, what’s human? “Ma’am, where is all the material you removed? This isn’t wallpaper.”</p>
